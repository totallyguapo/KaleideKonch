The Kaleidekonch Project
The Kaleidekonch Project
Project Overview
The Kaleidekonch project is a groundbreaking fusion of natural materials and advanced technology
to create a unique and expressive musical instrument. Drawing inspiration from ancient Indigenous
practices of using konch shells as instruments, this project reimagines these traditions for the
modern era. The Kaleidekonch retains the organic essence of the konch shell while seamlessly
integrating digital technologies to expand its sonic and gestural possibilities. The instrument is
designed to invite participation, foster collaboration, and bridge the gap between natural acoustics
and contemporary performance technology.
Project Vision
The Kaleidekonch project envisions:
- Cultural Continuity: Honoring the historical use of konch shells in music while adapting their use for
new forms of expression.
- Accessibility and Collaboration: Encouraging participation and exploration in both individual and
group contexts through an intuitive, tactile, and responsive design.
- Technological Integration: Seamlessly incorporating digital enhancements to broaden the sonic
palette while maintaining the instrument's organic origins.
Central to this vision is a harmonious blend of tradition and innovation. The Kaleidekonch leverages
advanced sensor technologies to transform the konch into an interactive, multisensory instrument
while preserving its natural aesthetic and acoustic qualities.
Key Features

The Kaleidekonch Project
- Sensor Integration: The Kaleidekonch is equipped with an array of sensors, including:
- An electret microphone for breath input.
- Piezo microphones for capturing subtle vibrations and percussive gestures.
- 14 force-sensing resistors (FSRs), three of which are embedded within a continuous sensing valve
system for nuanced control.
- An accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer for orientation tracking, enabling dynamic spatial
interaction.
- Tactile Enhancements: The konch shell is coated in soft, pliable rubber, providing performers with
a tactile surface that responds to continuous force gestures. This coating enhances comfort,
enables fluid interaction, and transforms the shell into an active interface.
- Haptic Feedback: A built-in exciter delivers haptic feedback, allowing performers to feel the
instrument's sonic responses, creating a deeply immersive and intuitive playing experience.
- Breath Control: Dynamic breath input, captured via electret microphones and piezos, offers
performers precise control over sonic parameters, enabling expressive and nuanced performances.
- Valve Design: Non-acoustic, spring-based valves inspired by trumpet mechanics provide smooth
actuation, allowing performers to modulate airflow and sonic effects with precision. These valves
include embedded sensors to capture depth and pressure for enhanced control.
Completed Milestones
1. Valve Development:
- Engineered spring-based valves with over an inch of depth for mechanical precision and ease of
use.

The Kaleidekonch Project
- Incorporated embedded sensors into the valve system to capture continuous and nuanced gestural
data.
2. Breath Input System:
- Designed and implemented a hybrid breath control system using electret microphones and piezo
sensors.
- Established mappings that translate breath input into dynamic sound modulations.
3. Preliminary Testing:
- Conducted airflow experiments to optimize sound transformation within the konch shell.
- Evaluated the integration of sensors and haptic feedback in creating a seamless user experience.
4. Scanning and Rubber Mold Development:
- Scanned the konch shell to capture its detailed external and internal geometry.
- Created a rubber mold from the scanned data, ensuring a tactile and responsive layer that
supports continuous force feedback gestures.
5. Tactile and Haptic Features:
- Applied a soft rubber coating for continuous force gesture sensing.
- Integrated an exciter to provide real-time haptic feedback, enhancing performer-instrument
interaction.
Future Directions
- Interior Modeling: Refining the internal geometry of the konch shell to optimize airflow and acoustic
resonance while respecting its natural spiral structure. This approach draws on research from Le,
Ghazlan, and Ngo's study, 3D Printing and Numerical Modelling of Konch-Inspired Lamellar

Structures (2019), which informs the reconstruction of the konch's complex internal pathways to
enhance performance capabilities.
- Expanded Sonification: Developing advanced mapping systems to translate breath, valve, and
gesture inputs into complex, evolving sonic textures.
- Ergonomic Refinements: Testing prototypes with musicians to improve comfort, responsiveness,
and usability in live performance settings.
- The Physical Modeling of Chime Acoustics: Investigating the acoustic properties of chimes through
physical modeling to integrate their resonant qualities into the Kaleidekonch's sound palette. Chimes
complement the kaleidic konch aesthetic, offering a sonically rich and visually harmonious extension
of the instrument's creative and artistic scope.
- Educational Outreach: Creating tutorial materials and open-ended resources to encourage both
new and experienced performers to engage with the instrument.
Conclusion
The Kaleidekonch represents a bold step forward in reimagining natural instruments for the digital
age. By integrating tactile, haptic, and digital feedback systems into the organic framework of a
konch shell, the project creates a versatile instrument that bridges ancient traditions with modern
innovation. The Kaleidekonch fosters inclusivity, creativity, and a deep connection between
performer and instrument, inviting musicians to explore its sonic potential and expand their
expressive horizons.
